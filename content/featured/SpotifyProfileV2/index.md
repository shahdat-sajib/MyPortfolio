I developed a full-stack Travel Agency Website that allows users to explore destinations, view detailed tour packages, and make secure bookings online.

The platform features:

Dynamic tour & destination pages with a responsive Tailwind CSS UI ✈️🌐

Role-based authentication (admin/user) and a cart-based booking system 🔐🧾

Secure Stripe payment integration and admin dashboard for managing content 💳📊

Scalable backend powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, deployed to production 🚀

The project is already in production server.
