Iâ€™ve developed an advanced Regression/Smoke Report Analyzer designed to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of test data. Built with scalability in mind, this tool is tailored for enterprise-grade projects with extensive API coverage.

By integrating AI-driven analysis, the tool automatically categorizes failed test cases, identifies root causes, and highlights critical patterns. This enables QA teams and stakeholders to:

âœ… Quickly assess the current health of the project

ðŸ“Œ Prioritize issues

ðŸ“¤ Make informed decisions with confidence

â€¦even across complex and high-volume test suites ðŸš€.
